Introduction
============

MeshCat_ is a remotely-controllable 3D viewer, built on top of [three.js](https://threejs.org/). The MeshCat viewer runs in a browser and listens for geometry commands over WebSockets. This makes it easy to create a tree of objects and transformations by sending the appropriate commands over the websocket.

This package, meshcat-python, allows you to create objects and move them in space from Python. For some examples of usage, see `demo.ipynb`.
